# Group_7_Challenge_1: US Rental Market Analysis (2010-2017)
Welcome to the **Group_7_Challenge_1** project repository! Here, we delve into the intricate landscape of the US rental market across cities and states from 2010 to 2017. Our primary goal is to unearth meaningful patterns and relationships between different states, cities, and their respective median rent prices.
## Project Description ## Research Questions
In this project, we undertake an in-depth analysis of the US rental market, specifically focusing on the years 2010 to 2017. We're committed to addressing the following key research questions:
1. How did the median rent price in the states (New York, California, Illinois, Texas) change across the years 2011 to 2016, compared to the overall US trend?
2. Among the selected US states, which one experienced the most significant change in median rent price?
Our exploration will encompass several intriguing facets, including:
1. **Patterns of Change:** We'll examine how the median rent price evolved across the states (NY, CA, IL, TX) from 2011 to 2016 and contrast it against the overall US trend.
2. **Regional Variations:** We'll identify which of the four states had the most remarkable variation in median rent prices.
## Visualizations
Our analysis is accompanied by a variety of informative visualizations:
- A line graph illustrating the average rent costs across the entire US from 2011 to 2016.
- A visual representation showcasing California's substantial increase in rent prices between 2011 and 2016.
- A comprehensive line graph displaying the average rent costs for New York, California, Illinois, Texas, and the entire US from 2011 to 2016.
- Box plots offering a comparative view of rent prices for New York, California, Illinois, Texas, and the entire US.
- Histograms presenting the distribution of rent prices across the same regions.
- Individual scatter plots for New York, California, Illinois, Texas, and the entire US, spotlighting monthly median rent prices from 2011 to 2016.
## Hypotheses
We put forth two hypotheses:
- Null Hypothesis: There is no statistically significant difference in rent prices among different US states/regions.
- Alternate Hypothesis: New York stands out with a statistically significant difference in rent prices compared to the rest of the US.
## Analysis and Conclusions
Our analysis culminates in comprehensive insights:
1. **Rent Trends:** Texas and California experienced notably steeper rent increases compared to the broader US trend. In contrast, Illinois witnessed a more restrained escalation, while New York saw a decline.
2. **Greatest Rent Change:** California boasted the most substantial rise in rent prices between 2011 and 2016.
## Additional Insights
Certainly, here are a few more points you could consider adding to the conclusion section of your README:
## Additional Analysis and Conclusions
In addition to the key findings mentioned above, our exploration of the US rental market yields further insights:
### Rent Stability and Competitive Market
The absence of outliers in the data underscores the remarkable stability of the rental market. The lack of extreme values suggests that competition among states and regions keeps rent prices relatively consistent. This observation aligns with the notion that market forces and demand-supply dynamics play a significant role in shaping rental costs.
### Regional Disparities and Socioeconomic Factors
While Texas and California experienced substantial increases in rent prices, Illinois demonstrated a more measured escalation. These variations might be attributed to a combination of socioeconomic factors, employment trends, urban development, and local regulations. Such insights can be invaluable for policymakers and real estate stakeholders in understanding the nuances of each state's rental landscape.
### Impact of Economic Growth and Demand
The notable increase in California's rent prices between 2011 and 2016 reflects the state's robust economic growth and demand for housing. Conversely, New York's decline in rent prices indicates a potential market correction or shift in demand. These fluctuations could be driven by factors such as job opportunities, population growth, and shifts in lifestyle preferences.
### Implications for Future Analysis
While our analysis sheds light on rent trends and disparities during the specified period, it also sets the stage for more comprehensive investigations. Future work could involve examining correlations between rent prices and demographic changes, exploring the impact of real estate market cycles, and evaluating the potential influence of policy changes on rental costs.
## Project Reflection
This project has allowed us to delve into the intricate realm of data analysis and visualization. Through the exploration of rent prices, we've gained valuable insights into the dynamics of the US rental market and its multifaceted interactions with socioeconomic factors. The combination of statistical analysis and visual representation has empowered us to effectively communicate our findings and contribute to the broader understanding of this important economic aspect.
We look forward to further refining our analytical skills and leveraging data-driven insights to unravel more complex challenges in the future.
