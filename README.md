# Project Description
The aim of our project is to uncover patterns of the US rental market based across cities and states throughout 2010-2017. We'll examine relationships between different states and cities and their respective median rent prices.

# Research Questions to Answer: 
1. How did the median rent price in the states (NY, CA, IL, TX) change across time (2011-2016) compared to the US as a whole?
2. Which of the US states (NY, CA, IL, TX) had the greatest change in median rent price?

# Vizualisations 
A line graph showing the average cost of rent in the US from 2011-2016
California had the largest increase in rent between 2011-2016.

A histogram for (NY, CA, IL, TX, US) comparing rent prices.
Individual scatter plots for (NY, CA, IL, TX, US) showing the median rent price each month from 2011-2016

# Hypotheses:
Null hypothesis: There is no statistical significant difference in rent across US states/regions.
Hypothesis: New York had the most significant difference in rent compared to the rest of the US.

# Analysis and Conclusions
# 1. How did the median rent price in the states (NY, CA, IL, TX) change across time (2011-2016) compared to the US as a whole?
Texas and California exhibited more substantial increase compared to the United States trend. Conversely, Illinois experienced tempered rate of escalation, while New York even witnessed a decline.

# 2. Which of the US states (NY, CA, IL, TX) had the greatest change in median rent price?
California had the largest increase in rent between 2011-2016.

# Other Conclusions
Three of the four states we selected had an increase in rent between 2011 - 2016.
There are no outliers in the data, meaning competition keeps rent prices close.
